# What is a Class?
A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. An object is an instance of a class. This is the standard definition of Class. Apex Classes are similar to Java Classes.

For example, InvoiceProcessor class describes the class which has all the methods and actions that can be performed on the Invoice. If you create an instance of this class, then it will represent the single invoice which is currently in context.
